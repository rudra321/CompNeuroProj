Follow these stesp to make the code work on your locale system :-
1. Download the code as ipynb file.
2. The code is divided in two sections. One being Chapter 1, the Hodgkin Huxley modal simulation. Chapter 2 being adding noise to the system.
3. Open google colab and copy & paste or import the downloaded ipynb file in the google colab.
4. NEURON is need for the system to function, so we install NEURON software in the system.
5. Run ```!pip install neuron``` as it imports NEURON libraries to the system.
6. In the code, rest of the important libraries are mentioned. Install them for the rest of the code to work.
7. Now run the code, cell by cell, to find the results in the REPORT mentioned.
8. In case of errors, disconnect and run all cells again. This is because sometimes, few variables take on the garbage value.
