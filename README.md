Follow these steps to make the code work on your locale system :-
1. Download the code as ipynb file.
2. The code is divided in two sections. One being Chapter 1, the Hodgkin Huxley modal simulation. Chapter 2 being adding noise to the system.
3. Open google colab and copy & paste or import the downloaded ipynb file in the google colab.
4. NEURON is needed for the system to function, so we install NEURON software in the system.
5. Run the first cell to install all the important libraries including the NEURON software libraries.
6. Now run the code, cell by cell(for a particular section), to find the results in the REPORT mentioned, starting with ```INIT```.
7. When moving to the next section, disconnect and delete run time. Re-run the ```INIT``` section, then move to the desired section to run the code.
8. In case of errors, disconnect and run import cell again. And then run the desired code.
